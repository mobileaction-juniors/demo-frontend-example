/**
 * Global CSS file - Required to initialize Tailwind CSS
 * 
 * WHY this file exists:
 * - Tailwind CSS must be imported somewhere to be available globally
 * - This file is imported in main.ts to load Tailwind styles
 * - Without this import, @apply directive won't work in components
 * - All Tailwind utility classes need this global import to function
 * 
 * Reference: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/vite
